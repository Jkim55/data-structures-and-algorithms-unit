# Data Structures and Algorithms

In this unit you will learn about and implement several Abstract Data Structures. You will analyze their characteristics, and their pros and cons by determining the Big-O complexity of their operations.

Your capstone project will require you to leverage your new found knowledge to produce a maze solver and pathfinding AI.

You will:

 * Understand and implement a series of classic data structures in Ruby
 * Learn fundamental data structures from an abstract perspective, so that you can discuss them in a language-agnostic manner
 * Learn the strengths of weaknesses of various data structures in order to make informed choices
 * Apply your knowledge of data structures to produce classic algorithms
